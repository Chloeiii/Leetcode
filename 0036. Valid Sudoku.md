## 36. Valid Sudoku (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 

Example 1:

        Input: board = 
        [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
        ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
        ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
        ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
        ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
        ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
        ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
        ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
        ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
        Output: true
Example 2:

        Input: board = 
        [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
        ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
        ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
        ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
        ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
        ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
        ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
        ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
        ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
        Output: false
        Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
         

Constraints:

      board.length == 9
      board[i].length == 9
      board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
