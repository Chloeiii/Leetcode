## Coin Change
https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:
    
    Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
Example 2:

    Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
    Output: -1
Example 3:

    Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
    Output: 0
 

Constraints:
    
    1 <= coins.length <= 12
    1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
    0 <= amount <= 104

    class Solution {
        public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
            //use dynamic programming (DP)
            if (amount == 0) return 0;
            
            //initialize a dp array
            int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
            Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1); //use amount + 1 as an impossible high value
            dp[0] = 0; // No coins needed to make 0
            
            // Iterate through each amount from 1 to 'amount'
            for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
                for (int coin : coins) {
                    if (i >= coin) {
                        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
            // If dp[amount] is still the initial value, return -1 as no solution exists
            return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1 : dp[amount];
        }
    }



    Time Complexity: O(n * amount), where n is the number of coins and amount is the target amount.
    This is because for each coin, we loop over all amounts from 1 to amount.

    Space Complexity: O(amount), as we only use a 1D array dp of size amount + 1.
