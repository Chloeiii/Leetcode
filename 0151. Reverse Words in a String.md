## 151. Reverse Words in a String (Medium)


Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:
    
    Input: s = "the sky is blue"
    Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

    Input: s = "  hello world  "
    Output: "world hello"
    Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:
    
    Input: s = "a good   example"
    Output: "example good a"
    Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
     

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 104
    s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
    There is at least one word in s.
     

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

✒️java

    //String.trim()
    //String.split("\\s+")
    //use StringBuilder instead of String to optimize space complexity
    
    class Solution {
        public String reverseWords(String s) {
            if(s.length() == 1) return s;
            s = s.trim();//remove leading and trailing spaces
            String[] arr = s.split("\\s+");//remove spaces
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for(int i=arr.length-1; i>=0; i--){
                sb.append(arr[i]);
                if(i!=0){
                    sb.append(" ");
                } 
            }
            return sb.toString();
        }
    }

    Time:    O(n)
    Space:   O(n)
