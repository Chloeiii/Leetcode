## 74. Search a 2D Matrix (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description/

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

 

Example 1:
    
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)  

    Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
    Output: true
Example 2:
    
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)    
    Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
    Output: false
     

Constraints:
    
    m == matrix.length
    n == matrix[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 100
    -104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

  
  🙇‍♂️java
  
    class Solution {
        public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
            int row = matrix.length;
            int col = matrix[0].length;
    
            //binary search
            //consider the matrix as a sorted array
            int left = 0;
            int right = row * col - 1;
            
            while(left <= right){
                int mid = (left + right)/2;
                int midElement = matrix[mid/col][mid%col];
                if(midElement == target) return true;
                if(midElement > target){
                    right = mid-1;
                }else{
                    left = mid+1;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
    }

    Space: O(1)
