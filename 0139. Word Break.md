## Word Break
https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/description/

Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

 

Example 1:

    Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

    Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
    Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:
    
    Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
    Output: false
     

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 300
    1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
    1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
    s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
    All the strings of wordDict are unique.

      class Solution {//use recursive approach
          private Set<String> badCases = new HashSet<>();//store the set of strings that cannot be segmented
          
          public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
              Set<String> wordDictSet = new HashSet<String>(wordDict);
              return findNext(s, wordDictSet);
          }
          
          private boolean findNext(String next, Set<String> wordDictSet){
              if(next.isEmpty()) return true;
              if(badCases.contains(next)) return false;
              
              for(int i=1; i<=next.length(); i++){
                  String prefix = next.substring(0,i);
                  if(wordDictSet.contains(prefix)){
                      if(findNext(next.substring(i), wordDictSet)) return true;
                  }
              }
              
              badCases.add(next);
              return false;
          }
      }

      Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string s. This comes from iterating over all possible substrings of s
      
      Space Complexity:
      O(n) for memoization, where n is the length of the string s. In the worst case, we might store all substrings of s in the memo set.
      O(k) for the space used by wordSet, where k is the number of words in the dictionary wordDict.
