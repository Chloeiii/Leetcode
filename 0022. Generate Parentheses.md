## Generate Parentheses - Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

 

Example 1:

    Input: n = 3
    Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

Example 2:

    Input: n = 1
    Output: ["()"]



Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 8

    class Solution {
        List<String> result  = new ArrayList<>();
        public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
            generateCombinations(n-1 , n, "(");
            return result;
        }
        
        //l: num of left parentheses left
        //r: num of right parentheses left
        private void generateCombinations(int l, int r, String prev){
            if((l == 0) && (r == 0)){
                result.add(prev);
                return;
            }
            if(l > 0){  //left parenthesis can still be added
                generateCombinations(l-1, r, prev+"(");
            }
            if(l < r){ //a right parenthesis can be added to match a previous unmatched left parenthesis
                generateCombinations(l, r-1, prev+")");
            }
            
        }
    }

  
  1. Base Case: Start by identifying the base case. When n is 0, there's only one possible combination: an empty string.
  
  2. Recursive Case: For each pair of parentheses, you have two options: open a new parenthesis or close an existing open parenthesis. So, you'll recursively generate combinations by trying both options for each parenthesis.
  
  3. Recursion with Backtracking: Use recursion to explore all possibilities. When adding an open parenthesis, decrement n by 1 to indicate that one opening parenthesis has been used. When adding a closing parenthesis, make sure there's a matching open parenthesis available (meaning n hasn't reached 0 yet).
  
  4. Build and Return the Combinations: As you explore the possibilities, build and store the combinations in a list. Once you've exhausted all possibilities for a given state, return the list of combinations.
