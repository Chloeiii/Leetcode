## 63. Unique Paths II (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)

    Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
    There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
    2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

    Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
    Output: 1
 

Constraints:

    m == obstacleGrid.length
    n == obstacleGrid[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 100
    obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
