## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

    Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:
    
    Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
    Output: 9
Example 3:
    
    Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
    Output: 3
     

Constraints:

    0 <= nums.length <= 105
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

            for(int num: nums) set.add(num);
    
            int longest = 1;
            for(int num: set){
                //only start counting a sequence if the number is the "start" of a sequence
                if(!set.contains(num-1)){
                    int curLen = 1;
                    int nextNum = num+1;
                    while(set.contains(nextNum)){
                        curLen ++;
                        nextNum ++;

                    longest = Math.max(longest, curLen);

            return longest;
        }

    //Space   O(n)
