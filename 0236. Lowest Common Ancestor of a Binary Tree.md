## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

[https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 

Example 1:

    
    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:

    
    Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
    
Example 3:
    
    Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
    Output: 1
     

Constraints:
    
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
    -109 <= Node.val <= 109
    All Node.val are unique.
    p != q
    p and q will exist in the tree.
