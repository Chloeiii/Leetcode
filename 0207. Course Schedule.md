## Course Schedule - Medium
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
    Output: true
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
    To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

    Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
    To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


Constraints:

    1 <= numCourses <= 2000
    0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
    prerequisites[i].length == 2
    0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
    All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
