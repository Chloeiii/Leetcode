## 547. Number of Provinces (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

 

Example 1:

    Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
    Output: 2
Example 2:

    Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
    Output: 3
     

Constraints:
    
    1 <= n <= 200
    n == isConnected.length
    n == isConnected[i].length
    isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
    isConnected[i][i] == 1
    isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]
